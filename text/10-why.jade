More and more people, including young kids, have access to technology at home, at school, at work, they have their own phones, tablets. Any of their tiny pocket devices has more processing power and connectivity than all the computers thirty years ago. A Â£50 tablet has more features than the original iPad.

  | Yet, despite this wonderfully powerful and shiny hardware being available and affordable, the best tools for teaching are still the whiteboard, the pen and paper. And this is to be expected, because proper software is lacking, because the content has not been adapted for the features the technology. Digital classrooms do not work.
